**Woocommerce > Products**

Select your existing product or create a new, and update the product information. Note the use of the following fields in the product information:

- **Inventory > SKU** - product ID
  - **Warehouse service**: this is product ID, which is used by warehouse also. Product is creted to the warehouse with this ID. The plug-in adds your business ID as a prefix to the front of the product ID. For example WooCommerce SKU "2001" will be sent as "01234567-8-2001" to warehouse.
  - **Dropshipping service** - this is supplier's product ID. You need to find out this value from Glue and input it manually or use CSV upload to create products in WooCommerce. Note that WooCommerce does not accept dublicate SKUs. If two suppliers have the same SKU, then workaround is to create a new SKU by Supplier with Grouped product feature.

  - **Posti Warehouse** - product is stocked and fulfilled by Posti warehouse
  - **Dropshipping** - product is stocked and order is fulfilled by supplier.

You can input here your supplier's business ID (or your own reference for the supplier) and Glue is using it when you place Purchse Order in Glue. This ensures that the Purchase Order does not have products from multiple suppliers, which would be error.
